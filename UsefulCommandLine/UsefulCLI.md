### Pull matching URLs (using ```grep```) from one file, output to another:

```
$ grep -oE '\b(https?|ftp|file)://[-A-Za-z0-9+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Za-z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]' orginalFile.txt > outputFile.txt

___

### Safely use ```rm``` 

Use the ```-i``` confirmation flag when running ```rm``` commands. From ```$ man rm```:

```
-i          Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file, regardless of the file's per-
                 missions, or whether or not the standard input device is a terminal.  The -i option over-
                 rides any previous -f options.
```

When deleting folders recursively w/ subfolders, run ```$ rm -rfi``` and get prompted for each file:

```
~/Temp $ ls temp123/
derp2.html   foo.test.bak testfoo.foo

~/Temp $ rm -rfi temp123/
examine files in directory temp123/? y
remove temp123//derp2.html? y
remove temp123//foo.test.bak? y
remove temp123//testfoo.foo? y
remove temp123/? y
~/Temp $
```
